Instruction for CA3 Group Assignment
January 2025 Semester
Assessment
This assessment is over 100 marks. It constitutes 40% of   the overall assessment. The   group assignment will cover 30% and the group   presentation will cover   10%.
Rationale of Group   ProjectThe   rationale   of the   group   project   is   to   enable   collaborative   learning with   your   peers   and   learning   to   work   as   a   team,   which   is   commonplace   in   workplace   environment.   Students learn to apply theories taught in class and textbooks to   real world situations.In line with this objective, students are not allowed to reuse old assignments, or submit   projects   from   previous   semesters   or   copy   largely   from   sources,   particularly   from   the   internet.
Forming GroupStudents are to form. groups of 4 to 5 students per group. As this a group project, each   member   is   expected   to   put   in   his/her   fair   share   of   the   effort   into   the    project.    It   is   essential that groups manage their group effectively to complete   this   project.Students   should   resolve   group   dynamics   issue   and   may   seek   the   mediation   through   the    lecturer    as    early    as    possible.    Last    minute    mediation    will    not      be    entertained.   Students may request for peer evaluation as   a   final   resort   if all   mediation   fails.Finally, the lecturer reserves the right to assign a mark   to   an individual student different   from the rest of the group if that student is deemed not to have put   in   his/her fair share   of effort into   the   project.
The Group Task:You   and   your   group   members   have   been   assigned   to   develop   a    Cake   Ordering   System   in Java that   provides functionality for managing cakes, customers,   and   order   information to a   cake shop.
The application should   be able   to:
1.      allow the cake shop staff to create, update,   delete   and   view   cakes.
2.      allow the cake shop staff to add, edit,   remove and   view   customers.
3.      allow the cake shop staff to make   and   cancel   orders.
4.      allow   the   cake   shop   staff   to   generate   reports   of   orders   by   date,   cake   and   customer.
5.      allow the cake shop staff to generate   reports of total number   of   orders.
6.      provide error handling for any   invalid   inputs from the cake shop   staff.
Project   Requirement
With   what   you    have   learned   from   the   module,   you    are   task   to   develop   the   Java   application with the following:
1.      Design   a   class   called   Cake   to   represent   a   cake   that   can   be   ordered   for   a   Customer.
Includ代 写Programming FundamentalsJava
代做程序编程语言e attributes such as:
-            Cake code   (e.g.   C001)
-          Cake   name   (e.g.   Chocolate   cake)
-            Cake   price   (e.g. 62.00)
Include   methods where appropriate.
2.      Design a class called Customer to   represent a   customer who   orders   a   Cake.
Include attributes such as:
-            Customer   ID   (e.g.   1001)
-            Full   name   (e.g. Jackie Chan)
-          Contact   number   (e.g.   91111111)
-          Delivery address   (e.g.   123   Clementi   Road, Singapore   599123)
Include   methods where appropriate.
3.      Design a class called Order to   represent   a   cake   order.
Include attributes such as:
-            Order   ID (e.g.   50001)
-            Order date   (e.g. 29/01/2025)
-            Cake
-            Customer
Include   methods where appropriate.
4.      Design      a      class      called      CakeOrderingSystem      to      coordinate      the      overall   application functionality.
Include attributes such as:
-            Cakes (ArrayList)
-            Customers (ArrayList)
-            Orders (ArrayList)
Include   methods to:
-            Manage   Cakes
-            Manage Customers
-            Manage Orders
-            Generate   reportsNote:   This   would   be   the   main   class.   You   are   to   use   all   classes   and   methods   created   to    achieve    the    following    options    that    the    application    can    perform.   Should you   require additional methods to support the   options, you   are   allowed   to   do   so.
5.      Implement   Error   Handling where appropriate.
6.      Illustrate   UML Class   Diagrams for all classes.
7.    Aside from the Java program, your group is to   write a Reflection word document   not exceeding 3000 words. The   reflection may contain the   following   pointers:
-          Things you   have learnt through   doing   the   assignment.
-          Challenges faced   in   programming or group work.
-          Screenshot and explanation on   unresolved/unachievable   requirements.
You are   required to satisfy all requirements   mentioned above.
You are free to add more appropriate fields and methods to the any of the above Java   classes.
You need to   handle all   possible errors that will occur during   the   program   execution.You   may   also   refer   to   a   sample   command   output   shown   in   Appendices   B,   C,   D,   E   and   F.   (Note:   You   do   not   need   to   follow   the   exact   output.   They   are   some   guides   to   show the essence of the Cake   Ordering System)
